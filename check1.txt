 assembly session brought much good the general assembly   which adjourns today   has performed in an atmosphere of crisis and struggle from the day it convened   this session   for instance   may have insured a financial crisis two years from now   in all the turmoil   some good legislation was passed   certainly all can applaud passage of an auto title law   the school bills   the increase in teacher pensions   the ban on drag racing   acceptance by the state of responsibility for maintenance of state roads in municipalities at the same rate as outside city limits   repeal of the college age limit law and the road maintenance bond issue   fortunately it spared us from the usual spate of silly resolutions which in the past have made georgia look like anything but    the empire state of the south      in the interim between now and next year   we trust the house and senate will put their minds to studying georgia s very real economic   fiscal and social problems and come up with answers without all the political heroics   it s a good use of money      if once they become inattentive to the public affairs      jefferson said      you and i   and congress and assemblies   judges and governors   shall all become wolves      the league workers search out the pros and cons of the most complex issues and make them available to the public   the harder the choice   the more

of normal growth but to encourage a more rapid rate of industrialization   the practice of charging employes for meals whether they eat at the hospital or not should be abolished   georgia has made

jesus maria galindez   a professor at columbia university in new york   has been laid at his door   but the price was the silence of the grave for all criticism or opposition   the dominican people have known no democratic institutions and precious little freedom for a generation   and all alternative leadership has been suppressed   such a twist would be a tragedy for the dominican people   who deserve to breathe without fear   because the buses would not stop on the parkway   land for bus stations and for parking areas nearby will be needed   the ncta is well advised to seek funds for this purpose from the present session of congress   so far as the record is concerned   the western powers have not acquiesced and should not do so   the wartime protocol of september 12   1944   designated a special    greater berlin    area   comprising the entire city   to be under joint occupation   it was not a part of any one of the three   later four   zones for occupation by soviet   american   british   and french troops respectively   after the berlin blockade and airlift   the council of foreign ministers in 1949 declared a purpose    to mitigate the effects of the present administrative division of germany and of berlin      the british and other replies to that moscow note pointed out efforts of the communist authorities    to integrate east berlin into east germany by isolating it from the outside and attempting to make it the capital of east germany      they insisted on the    fundamental fact    that    the whole of berlin has a quadripartite status      there remains   of course   the question of what the west can do beyond diplomatic protest to prevent the illegal efforts from becoming accomplished facts   prairie national park thousands of buffalo      bison    they will never be to the man on the street   grazing like a mobile brown throw rug upon the rolling   dusty green grassland   a horizon even and seamless   binding the vast sun bleached

many of them westward when the ohio and mississippi valleys began to fill   the national park service now proposes to preserve an area in pottawatomie county   northeast kansas   as a    prairie

assume responsibility for his performance in office   they   too   have links with the city s ills   levitt might turn out to be more independent than some of his leading supporters would like   his election   on the other hand   would unquestionably strengthen the    regulars      wagner might or might not be a    new    mayor in this third term   now that he is free of the pressure of those party leaders whom he calls    bosses      these are   of course   the same people whose support he has only now rejected to seek the independent vote   but his reelection would strengthen the liberal democrats and the labor unions who back him   the vote still gives citizens a voice in the operation of their government and their party   little war   big test both mr  for mr  kennedy   speaking softly and carrying a sizable stick is making the best of a bad situation   the new president is in no position to start out his dealings with moscow by issuing callable bluffs   he must show at the outset that he means exactly what he says   in this case he has put the alternatives clearly to mr  khrushchev for the third time   kennedy said      all we want in laos is peace not war a truly neutral government not a cold war pawn      khrushchev for the moment   but because of the peculiar nature of the military situation in laos   the soviet leader must be tempted to let things ride    a course that would appear to cost him little on the spot   but would bog washington in a tactical mess   as wars go   laos is an extremely little one   but if anything can bring home to mr  but for the safety of southeast asia   and for the sake of the laotian people    who would not be well ruled by either militant minority now engaged in the fighting    this last big effort to seal that country from the cold war had to be made   the funds would be used for equipment   not for land   buildings   or operation   a good man departs   goodby   mr  sam   sam rayburn was a good man   a good american   and   third   a good democrat   he was all of these rolled into one sturdy figure     mr  speaker   mr  sam   and mr  democrat   at one and the same time   the house was his habitat and there he flourished   first as a young representative   then as a forceful committee chairman   and finally in the post for which he seemed intended from birth   speaker of the house   and second most powerful man in washington   rayburn was not an easy man to classify or to label   he was no flaming liberal   yet the new deal   the fair deal and the new frontier needed him   two of the vital qualities demanded of a politician by other politicians are that he always keep a confidence and that he keep his word   sam rayburn took unnumbered secrets with him to the grave   for he was never loquacious   and his word   once given   was not subject to retraction   his leadership was not for audiences   a growl   a nod   was usually enough   when it was not   one of the great dramas of washington would be presented   he would rise in the well of the house   his chin upon his chest   his hands gripping the side of a desk   and the political and legislative chatter would subside into silence   he spoke briefly   sensibly   to the point and without oratorical flourishes   he made good   plain american common sense and the house usually recognized it and acted upon it   he expected democrats to do their duty when it had been patiently pointed out to them   with his long service he had a long memory   an excellent thing in a political leader   he was   of course   in the house for a very long time   there are only two men remaining in congress who   with rayburn   voted for the declaration of war against germany in 1917   to almost two generations of americans it must have seemed as though the existence of mr  sam coincided with that of the house   and it was the house he loved   to be presiding officer of it was the end of his desire and ambition   the senate to him was not the    upper body    and he corrected those who said he served    under    the president   he served    with    him   sound the roll of those with whom he served and who preceded him in death   woodrow wilson   with whom he began his years in washington   warren g  harding   calvin coolidge   fdr   with whom he managed a social revolution   and those still with us   herbert c  kennedy   he was a fighter for those of his own party   truman has only to recall the    hopeless    campaign of 1948 to remember what a loyal partisan he was and the first experience of mr  as it was   his absence because of his final illness was a blow to the administration   with republican presidents   he fought fair   he was his own man   not an automatic obstructionist   he kept his attacks on republicanism for partisan campaigns   but that is part of the game he was born to play   under any name    mr  speaker   mr  democrat   mr  sam    he was a good man   simply out of bloodlust   their murderers dismembered the bodies and tossed the remains into the river   last   it makes no sense to deliver katanga   the one reasonably solid territory   into the existing chaos   the congo should have been mandated   because it was not ready for independence   but if any realism and feeling for truth remain in the general assembly   it is time for men of courage to measure the magnitude of the failure and urge some new approach   the situation with regard to the southern pacific was therefore a special one and not necessarily applicable to other situations in other industries   meditations from a fallout shelter time was when the house of delegates of the american bar association leaned to the common sense side   but the internationalists have taken over the governing body of the bar   and when the lads met in st  it was   the brief writers decided      man s best hope for a peaceful and law abiding world      peace   it s wonderful   and    world law      it s wonderful   too   and shouldn t we get an international covenant extending it into space   before the russians put some claim jumper on the moon     meanwhile   in moscow   khrushchev was adding his bit to the march of world law by promising to build a bomb with a wallop equal to 100 million tons of tnt   to knock sense into the heads of those backward oafs who can t see the justice of surrendering west berlin to communism   a nuclear pacifier of these dimensions    roughly some six and a half times bigger than anything the united states has triggered experimentally    would certainly produce a bigger bang   and   just for kicks   khrushchev might use it to propel the seminar of the house of delegates from st  louis to the moon   where there wouldn t even be any beer to drink   while he was at it   the philosopher of the kremlin contributed an additional assist to the rule of reason by bellowing at those in the west who can t appreciate coexistence thru suicide      fools      he bayed      what do you think you are doing        the only response we can think of is the humble one that at least we aren t playing the marimba with our shoes in the united nations   but perhaps the heavy domes in the house of delegates can improve on this feeble effort   the craft made the familiar unwelcome flight to havana   where   for some unknown reason   castro rushed to the airport to express mortification to the colombian foreign minister   a passenger   who is not an admirer of old ten o clock shadow   the plane was sent back to the united states   for a change   but castro kept the crazy gunman   who will prove a suitable recruit to the revolution   pass the iron rations   please   and light another candle   for it s getting dark down here and we re minded to read a bit of world law just to pass the time away   the request for lower rates originated with the southern railway   which has spent a good deal of time and money developing a 100 ton hopper car with which it says it can move grain at about half what it costs in the conventional   smaller car   as head of the united nations he was the symbol of world peace   and his tragic end came at a moment when peace hangs precariously   it was on the eve of a momentous u  session to come to grips with cold war issues   hammarskjold was in africa on a mission of peace   he earnestly urged a cease fire   the story of the fatal crash is not fully known   the u  whether this   or overt action   was the cause of the crash must be promptly determined   the death of mr  he was controversial because he was uncompromising for peace and freedom with justice   he courageously defended the rights of small nations   and he stood his ground against the savage attacks of the communist bloc   the congo   in whose cause he died   was the scene of one of his greatest triumphs   hammarskjold   despite the danger   flew to exert a calming influence   he gave his life for his beliefs   the u  session scheduled for today will meet under the cloud of his passing   it is a crucial session with the world on the edge of momentous developments   that is the hope of mankind   too many have bogged down in bickering   the balance is being budgeted for the coming year   it is one of the rare public ventures here on which nearly everyone is agreed   so have the people s elected spokesmen at the state and federal levels   some accounts are quite lengthy but florida s is the shortest of all   requiring only four paragraphs   turner of miami      no complaints or charges have been filed during the past year   either verbally or written   from any individual or group      the committee continues to feel that florida has progressed in a sound and equitable program at both the state and local levels in its efforts to review and assess transition problems as they arise from time to time in the entire spectrum of civil rights      while some think we move too fast and others too slowly   florida s record is a good one and stands out among the 50   in order to form a new government it must deal with one of the two rival parties which gained strength   inevitably this means some compromise   both willy brandt s social democrats   who gained 22 seats in the new parliament   and the free democrats   who picked up 23   will insist on that before they enter the government   moon faced ludwig erhart   the economic expert   probably will ascend to the leadership long denied him   if the party of adenauer and erhart   with 45 per cent of the vote   approaches the party of willy brandt   which won 36 per cent   the result would be a stiffening of the old resolve   the free democrats   12 per cent of the vote   believe a nuclear war can be avoided by negotiating with the soviet union   and more dealings with the communist bloc   it could go either way   since the gains for both points of view were about the same   and the career of konrad adenauer   who upheld germany s tradition of rock like leaders which bismarck began   draws near the end   but it can be dangerous if the joiner doesn t want to make a spectacle of himself   for instance   so called    conservative    organizations   some of them secret   are sprouting in the garden of joining where    liberal    organizations once took root   one specific example is a secret    fraternity    which will    coordinate anti communist efforts      does it assail schools and churches with blanket accusations     2   does it put the label of un american or subversive on everyone with whom it disagrees politically     4   does it attempt to rewrite modern history by blaming american statesmen for wars   communism   depression   and other troubles of the world     5   do its spokesmen seem more interested in the amount of money they collect than in the principles they purport to advocate     in some instances a seventh question can be added   7   falling somewhere in a category between einstein s theory and sand fleas    difficult to see but undeniably there   nevertheless    is the tropical green    city    of islandia   a string of offshore islands that has almost no residents   limited access and an unlimited future   the latter is what concerns us all   whatever land you can see here   from the north tip end of elliott key looking southward   belongs to someone    people who have title to the land   and what you can t see   the land underneath the water   belongs to someone   too   the public   the only real problem is to devise a plan whereby the owners of the above water land can develop their property without the public losing its underwater land and the right to its development for public use and enjoyment   in the fairly brief but hectic history of florida   the developers of waterfront land have too often wound up with both their land and ours   in this instance   happily   insistence is being made that our share is protected   and until this protection is at least as concrete as   say   the row of hotels that bars us from our own sands at miami beach   those who represent us all should agree to nothing   we had assumed that at least this local legislative body had nothing to hide   and   therefore   had no objections to making the deliberations of its committees and the city commissions available to the public   in the preamble to the open meeting statutes   collectively known as the brown act   the legislature declares that    the public commissions   boards and councils and other public agencies in this state exist to aid in the conduct of the people s business      the people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them   the people   in delegating authority   do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know   the full implementation of these noble words   however   has taken the efforts of five sessions of the legislature   when all else fails   it is argued that open sessions slow down governmental operations   we submit that this is a most desirable effect of the law    and one of its principal aims   none of the trujillo family remains   but there was no complaint from the dominican crowds which lined ciudad trujillo s waterfront shouting      vive yankees        more   the u  juan bosch   as having saved    many lives and many troubles in the near future      he will need the help of all oas members to eradicate   finally   the forces of authoritarianism   pro trujillo and pro castro alike   now   as then   it is a matter of jobs   or that s what it looked like at the time   whether it could be as disastrous for american labor as   say   jimmy hoffa of the teamsters   is a matter of conjecture   but the jurisdictional disputes that result from the craft industrial rivalry do not win friends for labor   engaged as it is in a battle for world trade as a condition of national survival   this country can have little patience with labor s family feuds   the concept of labor as a special class is outmoded   and in the task confronting america as bastion of the free world   labor must learn to put the national interest first if it is itself to survive   deterrent the army   navy and air force   among others   may question secretary freeman s claim that the high estate of united states agriculture is the    strongest deterrent    to the spread of communism   but the secretary insists that the success of the american farmer is the    greatest single source of strength    in the struggle to insure freedom around the world   this shouldn t surprise the secretary     american taxpayers have been impressed by the surpluses for a long   long time   and thus far   mr  the result    1  the department needs a clearer    sense of direction    at the top and it needs fewer   but better   people   sen  the subcommittee is not alone in questioning the effectiveness of the department   but those who would revitalize so complex an organization must   first of all   overcome the resistance of layers of officials wedded to traditional procedures   suspicious of innovation and fearful of mistakes   jackson lists as the primary need       a clearer understanding of where our vital national interests lie and what we must do to promote them      jackson puts it      in work that does not really need doing      mitchell   when he was the head of the department   promised to eat his hat if unemployment didn t drop below three million a couple of years ago   he lost   but settled for a cake in the shape of a fedora   no betting man   mr  goldberg says he s merely    putting my neck out again    by predicting the rate will go down this month      i have to see the facts      is the way the prince puts it   hodges  appraisal   though there has been some reluctance to do so at the white house   he is the first top administration officer to see the bottom of the slump   the secretary based his assessment on the upturn in retail sales   in newark   for example   this gain was put at 26 per cent above the year earlier level   of course   some of the credit for the sale boost must be given to improvement in the weather and to the fact that easter comes more than two weeks earlier than in 1960   another optimistic sign   this one from the labor department   was the report that the long rise in unemployment compensation payments    was interrupted for the first time in the week ending feb  25      well   we can t have everything   in new jersey   too new jersey folk need not be told of the builder s

relationship between proper land use and economic growth   some plant location specialists take these signs to mean st  louis county doesn t want industry   and so they avoid the area   and more jobs are lost   louis s relatively slow rate of growth ought to be a priority concern of the political   business   civic and other leaders on both sides of the mississippi   an excess of zeal many of our very best friends are reformers   still we must confess that sometimes some of them go too far   take   for example   the reformers among new york city s democrats   de sapio in the primaries and thus come into control of tammany hall   they have changed the name to chatham hall   even though headquarters actually have been moved into the chatham building   do they believe that they can make the new name stick     granted that the tammany name and the tammany tiger often were regarded as badges of political shame   the sachems of the hall also have a few good marks to their credit   but it is tradition rather than the record which balks at the expunging of the tammany name   after all   it goes back to the days in which sedition was not un american   the days in which the sons of st  further   do our reforming friends really believe that the cartoonists will consent to the banishment of the tiger from their zoo     they will    when they give up the donkey and the elephant   instead of attempting the impossible   why not a publicity campaign to prove that all the tiger s stripes are not black     that might go over   moreover   col  swing   an eisenhower appointee as head of the immigration service   swing has received public attention before this for abuse of some of the prerogatives of his office   his official term expired last summer   some reports say he was rescued from timely retirement by his friend   congressman walter of pennsylvania   at a moment when the kennedy administration was diligently searching for all the house votes it could get   swing   the faget case was the kind of salvage job the administration should not have to repeat   as a former president   however   mr  eisenhower seized upon the incident of the postcard lost by a peace corps girl in nigeria to attack the entire corps as a    juvenile experiment    and to suggest sending a corps member to the moon   his words were the more ungracious to come from a man who lent his name to the eisenhower exchange fellowships dedicated to the same goal of international understanding   finally   mr  nobody can deny the right of former chief executives to take part in politics   but the american people expect them always to remember the obligations of national leadership and to treat issues with a sense of responsibility   this is a matter of respect for the presidency   queen of the seas the queen mary has long been a symbol of speed   luxury   and impeccable british service on the high seas   but the cunard line   influenced by unpleasant economic facts and not sentiment   has decided to keep the queen mary in service until next spring at least   a new queen   with the prosaic title of q3   had been planned for several years to replace the queen mary   since 1957   more and more trans atlantic passengers have been crossing by air   economy class fares and charter flights have attracted almost all new passengers to the airlines   competition from other steamship lines has cut cunard s share of sea passengers from one third to one fourth and this year the line showed a marked drop of profits on the atlantic run   the decline of the cunard line from its position of dominance in atlantic travel is a significant development in the history of transportation   taylor will report to president kennedy in a few days on the results of his visit to south

the outset to win a war the french were losing   it is a war to stay out of today   especially in view of the fact that president ngo dinh diem apparently does not want united states troops   he may want additional technical help   and this should be forthcoming   dalton   himself a lawyer and a man of long service in government   spoke with rich background and experience when he said in an address here that lawyers ought to quit sitting in the missouri general assembly   or quit accepting fees from individuals and corporations who have controversies with or axes to grind with the government and who are retained   not because of their legal talents   but because of their government influence   the u  of course it is   if the decision goes wrong   it may be    as mr  stevenson fears       the first step on the slippery path downhill    to a u  the integrity of the office not merely requires that the secretary general shall be   as the charter puts it      the chief administrative officer of the organization      but that neither he nor his staff shall seek or receive instructions from any government or any other authority    external to the organization      in other words   the secretary general is to be a nonpartisan   international servant   not a political   national one   he should be   as dag hammarskjold certainly was   a citizen of the world   the charter does stipulate that    due regard    shall be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on    as wide a geographical basis as possible      the united states and its allies have had no objection to this   what they have objected to is the attempt of the russians to make use of the tragedy of dag hammarskjold s death to turn the entire u  staff from the secretary down into political agents of the respective countries from which they come   the controversy now revolves mainly around the number and geographic origin of the deputies of the secretary general and   more particularly   around the nature of his relationship with them   have been arguing whether there shall be four   five or six top assistants   the most important element in the situation is not the number of deputies but the manner in which these deputies are to do their work   if they give him advice when he asks it   or if they perform specified duties under his direction   the nature of the u  will not of necessity change   what we must have   if the united nations is to survive   is as nonpolitical   nonpartisan an organization at the top as human beings can make it   subject to no single nation s direction and subservient to no single nation s ambition   what the new charter does the new city charter   which should get a yes vote as question no  7   would not make a good mayor out of a bad one

department of public works   such street cleaning as borough presidents now do   in queens and richmond   to the sanitation department   the expense   operating   budget is to be a program budget   and red tape is cut to allow greater autonomy   with the mayor approving   in fund transfers within a department   the capital budget   for construction of permanent improvements   becomes an

looking toward the kremlin this morning to be filled with admiration or rage    depending upon individual or national politics    because of the    bold program for building communism in our time    which the congress will adopt   and there must be many soviet citizens who know what is going on and who realize that before they can hope to enjoy the full life promised for 1980 they and their children must first survive   the widespread purge that has taken place the past twelve months or so among communist leaders in the provinces gives assurance that the party officials who will dominate the congress   and the central committee it will elect   will all have passed the tightest possible khrushchev screening   both for loyalty to him and for competence and performance on the job   his earlier reports considered the american public schools basically sound and not in need of drastic change   now   a close look at the schools in and around the ten largest cities   including new york   has shattered this optimism   conant has come away shocked and angry   his new book   entitled    slums and suburbs      calls for fast and drastic action to avert disaster   his strong opposition to the transfer of negro children to schools outside their own neighborhood   in the interest of integration   will be attacked by negro leaders who have fought for   and achieved   this open or permissive enrollment   it labels the slums   especially the negro slums   as dead end streets for hundreds of thousands of youngsters   the villains of the piece are those who deny job opportunities to these youngsters   and dr  the facts   he adds   are hidden from public view by squeamish objections to calling bad conditions by their right name and by insistence on token integration rather than on real improvement of the schools   regardless of the color of their students   a call for action    before it is too late    has alarming implications when it comes from a man who   in his previous reports on the schools   cautioned so strongly against extreme measures   he has served in positions of greater glamour   both at home and abroad     but he may well be doing his greatest service with his straightforward report on the state of the public schools   and now    more junk mail a fascinating letter has just reached this desk from a correspondent who likes to receive so called junk mail   in accordance with legislation passed at the last session of congress   each representative is authorized to deliver to the post office in bulk newsletters   speeches and other literature to be dropped in every letter box in his district   this means an added burden to innumerable postmen   who already are complaining of heavy loads and low pay   and it presumably means an increased postal deficit   but   our correspondent writes   think of the additional junk mail each citizen will now be privileged to receive on a regular basis   our creditors do not forget us letter writing is a dying art   old   tired   trembling the woman came to the cannery   she had   she said   heard that the plant was closing   it couldn t close   she said   she had raised a calf   grown it beef fat   she had   with her own work weary hands   put seeds in the ground   watched them sprout   bud   blossom   and get ready to bear   she was ready to kill the beef   dress it out   and with vegetables from her garden was going to can soup   broth   hash   and stew against the winter   she had done it last year   and the year before   and the year before that   and she   and her people were dependent upon these cans for food   this did not happen in counties of north georgia   where the rivers run and make rich the bottom land   nor in south georgia   where the summer sun shines warmly and gives early life to the things growing in the flat fields   this happened in decatur   dekalb county   not 10 miles from the heart of metropolitian atlanta   and now   the woman   tired and trembling   came here to the dekalb county cannery      is it so the cannery is going to close        o  moss   61   tall   grey as a possum   canning plant chief since 1946   didn t know what to say   he did say she could get her beef and vegetables in cans this summer   he did say he was out of cans   the no  3 s   but    i requisitioned 22 000      he said he had no  2 s enough to last two weeks more   threat of closing the cannery is a recent one   but dekalb citizens   those who use the facilities of the cannery   say the cannery is not supposed to make any money      the cannery      said mrs  lewellyn lundeen   an active booster of the cannery since its opening during the war and rationing years of 1941   to handle the    victory garden    produce      is a service to the taxpayer   and one of the best services available to the people who try to raise and can meat   to plant   grow vegetables and put them up   it helps those people who help themselves      the county   though   seems more interested in those people who don t even try   those who sit and draw welfare checks and line up for surplus food      a driver of a dairy truck   who begins work at 1 a  finishes before breakfast   then goes out and grows a garden   and who has used the cannery to save and feed a family of five   asked      what in the world will we do           what in the world      echoed others   those come with the beans   potatoes   the tomatoes      will any of us do        moss   a man who knows how much the cannery helps the county   doesn t believe it will close   but he is in the middle   an employe of dekalb   but on the side of the people   the young married people     the old couples   the dairy truck driver     the old woman with the stew      don t ask me if i think the cannery helps      he said      sir   i know the cannery helps      when a person has thoughtlessly or deliberately caused us pain or hardship it is not always easy to say      just forget it      there is one thing i know     a person will never have spiritual poise and inner peace as long as the heart holds a grudge   i know a man who held resentment against a neighbor for more than three decades   one night   at the close of the evening service   he came forward   left his resentment at the altar and gave his heart to god      we tried to settle this dispute      he said      but could never come to an agreement   i settled it tonight      he continued      i leave this church with a feeling that a great weight has been lifted off my heart   i have left my grudge at the altar and forgiven my neighbor      forgiveness is the door through which a person must pass to enter the kingdom of god   you cannot wear the banner of god and at the same time harbor envy   jealousy and grudges in your heart   henry van dyke said      forgive and forget if you can     but forgive anyway      we must   first of all   be willing to forgive others before we can secure god s forgiveness      for if ye forgive men their trespasses   your heavenly father will also forgive you   but if ye forgive not men their trespasses   neither will your father forgive    your trespasses      it will do no good to seek god s forgiveness until we have forgiven those who have done us wrong   in the prayer jesus taught his disciples to pray we find these words      forgive us our debts      when a person meets god s requirements for the experience of forgiveness he is forgiven   it also implies that a man wants his future to be free from the mistakes of the past   we want the past forgiven   but at the same time we must be willing for god to direct the future   once peter asked      how oft shall my brother sin against me   and i forgive him     till seven times     jesus saith unto him   until seventy times seven      jesus not only taught forgiveness   he gave us an example of it on the cross   with all the energy of his broken body he prayed      father   forgive them   for they know not what they do      she s been in and out of my house for a dozen years now   although she s still a teen ager who looks like a baby   she is getting married   her mother   now dead   was my good friend and when she came to tell us about her plans and to show off her ring i had a sobering wish to say something meaningful to her   something her mother would wish said   but when some of the squeals had subsided and she had been through one of those sessions that are so indispensable to the young female    six girls sprawled on one bed   drinking cokes and giggling    she came back to the kitchen to talk with me a minute      how do you know you love somebody enough to get married        she asked   it was the oldest and toughest question young lovers have ever asked   how can you be sure        aren t you sure        i asked   looking at her searchingly   i wanted to grab her by the arm and beg her to wait   to consider   to know for certain because life is so long and marriage is so important   besides   in all honesty   i don t know how you can be sure   i knew of but one test and i threw it out to her for what it was worth      does he ever bore you        i asked      bore me        she was shocked   oh   no o     why   he s so darling and       i mean      i went on ruthlessly      when he s not talking about you or himself or the wonders of love   is he interesting     does he care about things that matter to you     can you visualize being stranded with him on a desert island for years and years and still find him fascinating     because   honey   i thought silently   there are plenty of desert islands in every marriage    long periods when you re hopelessly stranded   together   and if you bore each other then   heaven help you   she came back the other day to reassure me   she asked if i had other advice and   heady with success   i rushed it in   i hope not too late   be friends with your mother in law   jokes   cartoons and cynics to the contrary   mothers in law make good friends   i do not know dr  it was the cry of not just one heart     it spoke for many in the clergy   i suspect   the pulpit is a lonely place   who stops to think of that     imagine the searching and the prayer that lay behind the letter the rector wrote after almost a decade of service to this majestic church      such a church needs vigor and vitality in its rector and one man has only so much of these endowments      he told his members   a minister should not stay    beyond the time that his leadership should benefit    his church   he wrote      for he becomes ordinary      and so the young minister resigned   to go and study and pray   having never passed a day   he told his parishioners   when    i did not gain from you far more than i ever gave to you      his very honest act called up the recent talk i had with another minister   a modest methodist   who said      i feel so deeply blessed by god when i can give a message of love and comfort to other men   and i would have it no other way   and it is unworthy to think of self   but oh   how i do sometimes need just a moment of rest   and peace   in myself      a man who gives himself to god and to the believers of his church takes upon himself a life of giving   he does not expect to get great riches or he would not have chosen to answer the call to preach   yet we who lean upon such a man and draw strength from him and expect interpretation of the infinite through him    we who readily accept his sacrifice as our due   we of the congregations are the first to tell him what is in our minds instead of listening to what is in his soul   we press him to conform to our comfortable conceptions and not to bruise our satisfactions with his word   and god s   we do not defeat the good ones with this cruelty   but we add to their burden   while expecting them to bestow saintliness upon us in return for ostentatious church attendance and a few bucks a week   american cash   we expect him to be noble   and to make us so    yet he knows   and tries to tell us   how very humble man must be   but how little love we give him   the church truly is not a rest home for saints   but a hospital for sinners   yet every sunday we sinners go to that emergency room to receive first aid   and we leave unmindful that the man who ministered to us is a human being who suffers   too   podger always particularly enjoyed the last night of each summer at loon lake   the narrow fringe of sadness that ran around it only emphasized the pleasure   this year   on a night cool with the front of september moving in   but with plenty of summer still about   the podgers were holding a neighborhood gathering in the pod   the little cottage was bursting with people of all ages   in the midst of it all   mr  podger came out on the pod porch   alone   he had that day attended a country auction   and he had come back with a prize   the prize was an old fashioned   woven cloth hammock   complete with cross top pillow   fringed side pieces   and hooks for hanging   podger had obligingly pushed things around on the porch to make room for it   and there it was   slung in a vine shaded corner   the night breeze rippling its fringe with a slow   caressing movement   podger sat down in it   pushed himself back and forth in one or two slow   rhythmic motions   and then swung his feet up into it   he closed his eyes and let the unintelligible drift of voices sweep pleasantly over him   suddenly one young voice rose above the others      but      it said      do you always know when you re happy        the voice sank back into the general tangle of sound   but the question stayed in mr  here   in the cool   autumn touched evening   mr  it had begun with the blue jay feather   walking along the lake before breakfast   mr  podger had seen the feather   and the bird that had lost it in flight   the winging spread of blue had gone on   calling harshly   into the wood   the small shaft of blue had drifted down and come to rest at his feet   all day long mr  podger   who was a straw hat man in the summer   had worn the feather in the band of his broad brimmed sunshield   would a blue feather in a man s hat make him happy all day     hardly   but it was something to have seen it floating down through the early morning sunshine   linking the blue of the sky with the blue of the asters by the lake   then   since the auction was being held nearby   he had walked to it   and there   on the way   had been the box turtle   that slow   self contained   world ignoring relic of pre history   bent   for reasons best known to itself   on crossing the road   podger saw hazard approaching in the shape of a flashy little sports car   would the driver see the turtle     would he take pains to avoid it     mr  taking off his hat and signaling the driver with it   mr  podger stepped into the road   lifted the surprised turtle and consummated its road crossing with what must have been a breath taking suddenness   but mr  podger and the driver of the sports car waved at each other   here in the cool darkness mr  podger could still feel the warmth of midday   could still see the yellow butterflies dancing over the road   could still see the friendly grin on the young   sun browned face as the driver looked back over his shoulder for a moment before the car streaked out of sight   where was the driver now     what was he doing     and the turtle     mr  for a few brief minutes they had all been part of one little drama   the three would never meet again   but for some reason or other mr  podger heard again     at will   the voice of the auctioneer   the voices of the bidders   and finally the small boy who had been so interested in mr     i like them things   too      he had said      we got one at home   you know what     if you re lyin  out in the hammock at night   and it gets kinda cool    you know    you just take these sides with the fringe on    see    and wrap  em right over you   i do it   lots o  times    i like to lie in a hammock at night   by myself   when it s all quiet   the wind moves it a little bit    you know      mr  podger had thanked him gravely   and now he made use of the advice   podger saw that thin   attractive   freckled little face again   and hoped that the boy   too   was lying in a cool   fringed wrapped quiet   alacrity   the podger cat   came by the hammock   rubbed her back briefly against it   and then   sure of a welcome   hopped up   she remarked that she found the night wind a little chilly   and mr  soon her purring rivaled the chirping of the tree crickets   rivaled the hum of voices from inside the pod   podger was just adding this to his pictures of the day when the screen door opened and pam burst out      dad        she said      it s getting so chilly we ve lighted a fire   and we re going to tell a round robin story    a nice   scary one   we need you to start it   why are you out here all by yourself     aren t you happy        mr  podger opened his cocoon and emerged   tucking alacrity under his arm to bring her in by the fire      of course i am      he said      never happier in my life   i just came out here to know it      desegregation is beginning in two more important southern cities    dallas and atlanta   the programs do not take sides on the issue itself   they point out simply that    it is the law of the land      the two cities have the examples of little rock and new orleans to hold up as warnings against resorting to violence to try to stop the processes of desegregation   even better   they have the examples of nashville and houston to hold up as peaceful and progressive programs   in nashville   a school was dynamited   it is a    stair step    plan   in which desegregation begins in the first grade   it met a serious rebuff in new orleans   where the two schools selected for the first moves toward integration were boycotted by white parents   generally   throughout the south   there is a growing impatience with the pattern of violence with which every step of desegregation is met   it was part of a citywide move toward full integration   hotels   for example   are ready to let down the bars   there are many causes for this change   one of the most important is economic   and as the businessmen have begun to act   a real sense of co operation has sprung up   played mostly on the freeways around los angeles   it goes like this   a driver cruising easily at 70 m    the adjacent driver in lane b has three choices open to him   he can   1   point his car resolutely at the invading fender and force the other driver back into lane a       2   slow down and permit the ambivalent driver to change lanes     or   3   alternately accelerate and decelerate   thus keeping the first driver guessing as to his intentions   thereby making a fascinating sport of the whole affair   whether or not this is done out of enlightened self preservation   i don t know   but it is done   consistently and i m both surprised and impressed   in chicago   the driver cut out would likely jam his gas pedal to the floor in an effort to force the other car back   failing this   he would pull alongside at the first opportunity and shake his fist threateningly   at the risk of losing my charge a plate at marshall field and company   i would like to challenge an old and hallowed stereotype   miami   fla    march 17   he can often make the complex ridiculously simple   and vice versa   this happened to be vice versa   but even so   the answer was a masterpiece      it s a whole lot easier      he said      to increase the population of nevada   than it is to increase the population of new york city      and with that he walked off to give instruction to a rookie pitcher      that is undoubtedly a hell of a quote      said the writer   scratching his head      now   if i can just figure out what he s talking about   i ll use it      some brilliant rookies nailed them down   so that this spring just two spots   left and right field   are really up for grabs   this angle of just where the orioles can look for improvement this year is an interesting one   you d never guess it from the way they ve played so far this spring   but there remains a feeling among some around here that the orioles still have a chance to battle for the pennant in 1961   obviously   if this club is going to move from second to first in the american league   it will have to show improvement someplace   where can that improvement possibly come from     you certainly can t expect the infield to do any better than it did last year   you can t expect it   though   he got off to an exceptional start last season   and under the circumstances probably won t duplicate it   they don t expect to stop him   just slow him down some with the bat   he ll still be a top player   they concede   because he s got a great glove and the long ball going for him   but they expect to reduce his over all offensive production   breeding might move up   don t ask him more   i have a hunch marv breeding might move up a notch   but even so   he had a good year in 1960 and won t do too much better   so   all in all   the infield can t be expected to supply the added improvement to propel the birds from second to first   and the pitching will also have trouble doing better   richards got a great performance out of his combination of youth and experience last season   where   then   can we look for improvement        from triandos   brandt and walker      answers richards      they re the ones we can expect to do better      the man is right   and at this time   indications are that these three are ready for better seasons   triandos hasn t proved it yet   but he says he s convinced his thumb is all right   he jammed it this spring and has had to rest it   but he says the old injury hasn t bothered him   if he can bounce back with one of those 25 home runs years   the club will have to be better off offensively   i m still not convinced   though   i ll have to see more of him before predicting that big year for him   hank foiles   backed up by frank house who will be within calling distance in the minors   make up better second line catching than the birds had all last year   but gus is still that big man you need when you start talking pennant   to me   brandt looks as though he could be in for a fine year   he s hitting the ball hard   in the batting cage   and his whole attitude is improved over this time last year   when he came to baltimore   he was leaving a team which was supposed to win the national league pennant   and he was joining what seemed to be a second division american league club   he was down   hard to talk to   and far too nonchalant on the field   as of now   that all seems behind him   let him bounce back   and he could really set up the staff   so   if the orioles are to improve   brandt   triandos and walker will have to do it   of course   this isn t taking into consideration the population of nevada and new york city   but it s the way things look from here at this point   is the mother of an    autistic    child at fault       the    autistic    child is one who seems to lack a well defined sense of self   he tends to treat himself and other people as if they were objects    and sometimes he treats objects as if they were people     did his mother make him this way     some people believe she did   we think differently   a mother can help a child adapt to his difficulties   sometimes she can    to a large extent    help him overcome them   but we don t think she creates them   the mother of a difficult child can do a great deal to help her own child and often   by sharing her experiences   she can help other mothers with the same problem   she wrote   total disinterest      as the mother of an autistic child who is lacking in interest and enthusiasm about almost anything   i have to manipulate my son s fingers for him when he first plays with a new toy   he wants me to do everything for him      you don t believe that autistic children become autistic because of something that happens to them or because of the way their mother treats them   but i do and my psychiatrist does   too   i know   that my son wants control and direction   but being autistic myself i cannot give full control or direction      one thing i notice which i have seldom heard mentioned   this is that autistic people don t enjoy physical contact with others    for instance   my children and i   when i hold my son he stiffens his whole body in my arms until he is as straight and stiff as a board   physical contact is uncomfortable for him        this mother is quite correct   parents have to find other ways of comforting him   for the young child this may be no more than providing food   light or movement   as he grows older it may be a matter of providing some accustomed object   his    magic    thing     or certain words or rituals that child and adult go through may do the trick   only ingenuity will uncover it   what future holds    dear doctors   we learned this year that our older son   daniel   is autistic   we did not accept the diagnosis at once   but gradually we are coming to   fortunately   there is a nursery school which he has been able to attend   with a group of normal children      i try to treat daniel as if he were normal   though of course i realize he is far from that at present   what i do is to try to bring him into contact with reality as much as possible   i try to give him as many normal experiences as possible      what is your experience with autistic children     how do they turn out later        many autistic children grow up to lead relatively normal lives   certainly   most continue to lack a certain warmth in communication with other people   but many adjust to school   even college   to jobs and even to marriage and parenthood   single color use question    a first grader colors pictures one solid color   everything    sky   grass   boy   wagon   etc    when different colors are used   she is just as likely to color trees purple   hair green   etc    the other children in the class use this same coloring book and do a fairly good job with things their proper color   is a relaxed home atmosphere enough to help her outgrow these traits     answer    her choice of one color means she is simply enjoying the motor act of coloring   without having reached the point of selecting suitable colors for different objects   this immature use of crayons may suggest that she is a little immature for the first grade   no   coloring isn t exactly something you teach a child   you sometimes give them a little demonstration   a little guidance   and suggestions about staying inside the lines   but most learn to color and paint as and when they are ready with only a very little demonstration   just as a varitinted oriental rug may suggest the starting point for a room scheme   so may some of the newest versions of embroidery   one such   in fact   is a rug   though not actually crewel embroidery   it

of the new testament   the first part of the new english bible   undertaken as a new translation of the scriptures into contemporary english   luther a  not rival the new english bible   the old testament and apocrypha will be published at a future date   has not been planned to rival or replace the king james version   but   as its cover states   it is offered    simply as the bible to all those who will use it in reading   teaching   or worship      bible reading   even more so than good classical music   grows in depth and meaning upon repetition   however   an initial perusal and comparison of some of the famous passages with the same parts of other versions seems to speak well of the efforts of the british biblical scholars   one is impressed with the dignity   clarity and beauty of this new translation into contemporary english   and there is no doubt that the meaning of the bible is more easily understandable to the general reader in contemporary language in the frequently archaic words and phrases of the king james   for example   in the third chapter of matthew   verses 13 16   describing the baptism of jesus   the 1611 version reads      then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan unto john   to be baptized of him      but john forbad him   saying   i have need to be baptized of thee   and comest thou to me        and jesus answering said unto him   suffer it to be so now   for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness   then he suffered him      and jesus   when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water   and lo   the heavens were opened unto him   and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove   and lighting upon him      clearer meaning certainly   the meaning is clearer to one who is not familiar with biblical teachings   in the new english bible which reads      then jesus arrived at jordan from galilee   and he came to john to be baptized by him   john tried to dissuade him     do you come to me       he said       i need rather to be baptized by you   jesus replied     let it be so for the present     we do well to conform this way with all that god requires   john then allowed him to come   after baptism jesus came up out of the water at once   and at that moment heaven opened     he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove to alight upon him          the paragraphing   spelling and punctuation are reproduced as printed in each version   to illustrate   the first blessing in the king james bible reads      blessed are the poor in spirit     for their s is the kingdom of heaven      the new version states      how blest are those who know that they are poor     the kingdom of heaven is theirs      some of the poetic cadence of the older version certainly is lost in the newer one   but almost anyone   with a fair knowledge of the english language   can understand the meaning   without the necessity of interpretation by a biblical scholar   in the second and third chapters of revelation the new version retains   however   the old phrase    angel of the church    which biblical scholars have previously interpreted as meaning bishop   this is not contemporary english   mostly contemporary for the most part   however   the new version is contemporary and   as such   should be the means for many to attain a clearer comprehension of the meaning of those words recorded so many hundreds of years ago by the first followers of christ   discoveries recently made of old biblical manuscripts in hebrew and greek and other ancient writings   some by the early church fathers   in themselves called for a restudy of the bible   to have the results recorded in everyday usable english should be of benefit to all who seek the truth   there is one danger   however   with contemporary english changing with the rapidity that marks this jet age   some of the words and phrases of the new version may themselves soon become archaic   the new testament offered to the public

to the easy control of a 2 year old child is a lack of verbal communication   the child understands no   he senses his mother s disapproval   but explanations leave him confused and unmoved   if his mother loves him   he clings to that love as a ballast   it motivates his behavior   he wants mommy to think him a good boy   he doesn t want her to look frowningly at him   or speak to him angrily   this breaks his heart   he wants to be called sweet   good   considerate and mother s little helper   his desires are so strong that he needs constant reassurance of his mother s love for him and what she expects of him   in order to overcome them   his own inner voice   which should tell him what not to do   has not developed   what can a mother do then to prevent misbehavior     she can decrease the number of temptations   she can remove all knick knacks within reach   the fewer nos she has to utter the more effective they will be   if he can t play with mommy s magazines   he should have some old numbers of his own   she tells him of the consequences of his behavior   if he bites a playmate she says      danny won t like you      if he snatches a toy   she says      caroline wants her own truck just as you do      there is no use trying to    explain    to a 2 year old   actions speak louder   remove the child from the scene of his misbehavior   he won t submit to his natural desires all the time   and it s mother s love that is responsible for his good behavior   this is the period during the melancholy days of autumn when universities and colleges schedule what they call    homecoming day      they seek thereby to lure the old grad back to the old scenes   the football opponent on homecoming is   of course   selected with the view that said opponent will have little more chance than did a christian when thrown to one of the emperor s lions   it is true   of course   the uncertainties of life being what they are   that as now and then the christian killed the lion   homecoming days have been ruined by a visiting team   even with all possible precaution   homecomings are usually rather cruel and sad   and only the perpetually ebullient and the continually optimistic are made happy by them   more often than not   as the old grad wanders along the old paths   his memory of happy days when he strolled one of the paths with a coed beside him becomes an ache and a pain   he can smell again the perfume she wore and recall the lilting sound of laughter   and can smell again the aroma of autumn    fallen leaves   the wine of cool air   and the nostalgia of woodsmoke which blows through all the winds of fall   undergraduates it is at precisely such moments that he encounters a couple of undergraduates   faces alight   holding hands and talking happily as they come along   oblivious of him   or throwing him the most fleeting and casual of glances   such as they would give a tethered goat   usually   they titter loudly after they have passed by   his dream goes   he feels   suddenly   the weight of the fat that is on him   his bridgework or his plates feel loose and monstrous   his bifocals blur   bitterness comes over him and the taste of time is like unripe persimmons in his mouth   it is not much better if he meets with old classmates   too often   unless he hails them   they pass him by   he recalls with a wry smile the wit who said   on returning from a homecoming reunion   that he would never go again because all his class had changed so much they didn t even recognize him   if they do meet and recognize one another   slap backs and embrace   the moment soon is done   after all   when one has asked whatever became of old joe and charlie when one has inquired who it was sue brown married and where it is they now live when

enough of his life was spent there on the field for him never to like watching the game as a spectator in the crowd   on a team a man feels he is a part of it and akin to the men next to him   in the stands he is lonely and lost   no matter how many are about him   he sits there remembering the tense moment before the ball was snapped     the churning of straining feet   the rasp of the canvas pants     the smell and feel of hot   wet woolen sleeves across his face   he remembers the desperate   panting breath     the long runs on the kick offs     the hard   jolting tackles     the breakthrough     the desperate agony of goal line stands   and so   he squirms with each play   remembering his youth   but it is no use   it is gone   no matter how often a man goes back to the

goldwater   bridges   dirksen   et al   is repeating the errors of the party leadership of the 1930s   hoover   and the party s failure to anticipate or cope with the depression   caused a great majority of americans to see the republican party as cold and lacking in any sympathy for the problems of human beings caught up in the distress and suffering brought on by the economic crash   the republican party was not lacking in humanity   but it permitted its extremely partisan leadership to make it appear devoid of any consideration for people in trouble   smokers reduced to    the

why the party won t win back city votes   every legislator from brasstown bald to folkston is going to have his every vote subjected to the closest scrutiny as a test of his political allegiances

bostitch   inc  the 1960 tax book for east greenwich indicates a valuation for this property in excess of two million dollars   with our current  3 per hundred tax rate   it is safe to assume that

sophomore at mount pleasant high school   my future plans are to become a language teacher   of course   having this desire   i am very interested in education   the article also said that a person had to be 18 years old or over   and must not be going to high school to attend these classes   the following week   i read in the sunday paper that the students of russia begin european and asian languages in the seventh grade   i wish you could see the situation as i see it   if russian pupils have to take these languages   how come american students have a choice whether or not to take a language   but have to face so many exceptions     i do not think that america is like russia   not in the least     i am proud of my country   the small city i live in   my wonderful parents   my

in the ensuing years   this matter is of great importance   and the outcome may mean the difference between life or death   or at least serious injuries   for many veterans   some critics say that the length of stay in a hospital is too long   there s a reason for this length of stay   first of all   the admitting physician in the va hospital gets the patient as a new patient   if the doctor is conscientious   he wants to study the patient   as a result   it takes a little longer than it would on the outside where the family physician knows about the patient   secondly   the va physician knows that when the patient leaves the hospital   he is no longer going to have a chance to visit his patient   so he keeps the veteran in until he can observe the effects of treatment or surgery   do

presidency when the man in the white house has had feelings of frustration   exasperation   exhaustion   and even panic   this we can sympathetically understand   barry goldwater     during his aggressive campaign to win his present position   mr  kennedy was vitriolic about this country s    prestige    abroad   what does he think a remark like this    lousy    one does to our prestige and morale     if the president of the united states really feels he won himself a    lousy job      then heaven help us all     aug  let us prepare for peace   instead of for a war which would mean the

wearing short shorts and the young men wearing bermuda shorts   is this what our children are to come face to face with when they are ready for college in a few years     education should be uppermost in their minds   but with this attire how can anyone think it is so     it looks more like they are going to play at the beach instead of taking lessons on bettering themselves   high school students have more sense of the way to dress than college students   many high school students go past my house every day   and they look like perfect ladies and gentlemen   no matter how hot the day   they

difficulties of the elderly   and i would be the last to say they should not receive consideration   but why is it the special responsibility of the cta to help these people     why should cta regular riders subsidize reduced transportation for old people any more than the people who drive their own cars or walk to work should     the welfare of citizens   old and young   is the responsibility of the community   not only of that part of it that rides the aj   cta regulars already subsidize transportation for school children   policemen   and firemen   marketing meat chicago   aug  9    in reply to a letter in today s    voice    urging the sale of meat after 6 p    i wish to state the other side of the story   i am the wife of the owner of a small   independent meat market   my husband s hours away from home for the past years have been from 7 a  now he is apparently expected to give up his evenings    and sundays   too   for this is coming   there is a trend to packaging meat at a central source   freezing it   and shipping it to outlying stores   where meat cutters will not be required   if a customer wishes a special cut   it will not be available   we are slowly being regimented to having everything packaged   whether we want it or not   most women   in this age of freezers   shop for the entire week on week ends   when prices are lower   also   many working wives have children or husbands who take over the shopping chores for them   no   we are not greedy   but if we closed the store for a vacation   we would lose our customers to the chain stores in the next block   the meat cutters  union   which has a history of being one of the fairest and least corrupt in our area   represents the little corner markets as well as the large supermarkets   what it is trying to do is to protect the little man   too   as well as trying to maintain a flow of fresh meat to all stores   with choice of cut being made by the consumer   not the store   9    i   too   congratulate the american legion   of which i am proud to have been a member for more than 40 years   on the recent state convention   i regret that bertha madeira   today s    voice      obtained incorrect information   had i been granted the floor on a point of personal privilege   the matter she raised would have been clarified   it was my desire to advise the membership of the legion that the majority of polling places are on private property and   without an amendment to the law   we could not enforce this   7    the illinois commission for handicapped children wishes to commend the recent announcement by the catholic charities of the archdiocese of chicago and depaul university of the establishment of the institute for special education at the university for the training of teachers for physically handicapped and mentally retarded children   the illinois commission for handicapped children   which for 20 years has had the responsibility of coordinating the services of tax supported and voluntary organizations serving handicapped children   of studying the needs of handicapped children in illinois   and of promoting more adequate services for them   indeed welcomes this new important resource which will help the people of illinois toward the goal of providing an education for all of its children   7    i just want to let you know how much i enjoyed your june 25 article on liberace   and to thank you for it   please do put more pictures and articles in about liberace   as he is truly one of our greatest entertainers and a really wonderful person   more school   less pay chicago   aug  7    is this   perhaps   one of the things that is wrong with our country     engineering graduates of illinois institute of technology are reported receiving the highest average starting salaries in the school s history     550 a month   my son   who has completed two years in engineering school   has a summer job on a construction project as an unskilled laborer   at a rate of  3  ironic   is it not   that after completing years of costly scientific training he will receive a cut in pay from what he is receiving as an ordinary unskilled laborer     the dupont case   editorial comment on this letter appears elsewhere on this page     washington   aug  kennedy and the department of justice was inaccurate   unwarranted and unfair   copies of this letter were made avaliable to the press and public   in this letter   mr  there are a number of other considerations besides this one but it is for the congress   not the department of justice   to balance these various considerations and make a judgment about legislation   yet your editorial said      now the attorney general writes that no considerations   justify any loss of revenue of this proportion        what mr  kennedy   in fact   wrote was      it is the department s view that no anti trust enforcement considerations justify any loss of revenue of this proportion      the headline is offensive   particularly in view of the total inaccuracy of the editorial   7    i concur most heartily with today s letter on the futility of writing to sen  douglas   but when you write to congresswoman church   bless her heart   your letter is answered fully and completely   should she disagree   she explains why in detail   when she agrees   you can rest assured her position will remain unchanged   i think we have the hardest working   best representative in congress   they do our country great harm by such actions   the plane should have started at the scheduled time and left sinatra and martin to guzzle   this is a step toward overt socialism      workers of the party    to the editor   sir    we are writing in reference to a recent    suggestion    made to the staff of the public health nursing service of jersey city   registered professional nurses with college background and varying experiences     the day before election day   to which we are entitled as a legal holiday   we were informed to report to our respective polls to work as    workers of the party      to our knowledge no nurse in our agency has been employed because of political affiliation   we   therefore   considered the    suggestion    an insult to our intelligence   ethics   bill of rights   etc    our only obligation for this day is to vote   free of persuasion   for the person we feel is capable in directing the public   this is our duty    not as nurses or city employes    but as citizens of the united states      plus one    shelters to the editor   sir    i read of a man who felt he should not build a fallout shelter in his home because it would be selfish for him to sit secure while his neighbors had no shelters   does this man live in a neighborhood where all are free loaders unwilling to help themselves   but ready to demand that    the community    help and protect them     community shelters are   of course   necessary for those having no space for shelter   if in a town of 2 000 private homes   half of them have shelters   the need for the community shelters will be reduced to that extent   in designing his home fallout shelter there is nothing to prevent a man from planning to shelter that home s occupants      plus one       so he will be able to take in a stranger   i hope the man who plans to sit on his hands until the emergency comes will have a change of heart   will get busy and be the first member of our    plus one    shelter club   escape to the editor   sir    people continue to inquire the reason for the race for outer space   it s simple enough from my point of view   i am for it   it is the only method left for a man to escape from a woman s world   supports katanga to the editor   sir    when the colonies decided upon freedom from england   we insisted   through the declaration of independence   that the nations of the world recognize us as a separate political entity   in the united nations charter   the right of self determination is also an essential principle   this   again   applies to katanga   the people of katanga had fought for   and obtained   their freedom from the communist yoke of antoine gizenga   and his cohorts   by political   economic   geographic and natural standards   they were justified in doing so   the united states and the u  denounce their own principles when they defend the communist oppressors and refuse to acknowledge the right of self determination of the katangans   the trustees will prepare an annual budget for the college and submit it to the board of school estimate   this board will consist of two of the trustees of the college   and the director and two members of the board of freeholders   the approval of only three members of the board of school estimate is required to certify the amount of money to be allotted to the college   since two of these could be trustees of the college   actually it would be necessary to have the consent of only one elected official to impose a levy of millions of dollars of tax revenue   taxing improvements to the editor   sir    your editorial      housing speedup      is certainly not the answer to our slum problems   the very rules and regulations in every city are the primary case of slum conditions   then see what a boom in all trades   as well as slum clearance at no cost to taxpayers   will happen      natural causes    to the editor   sir    an old man is kicked to death by muggers   the medical examiner states that death was due to    natural causes      i once heard a comedian say that if you are killed by a taxicab in new york   it is listed as    death due to natural causes      praises exhibit to the editor   sir    every resident of this city should visit the newark museum and see the exhibit    our changing skyline in newark      parkway courtesy to the editor   sir    i hasten to join in praise of the men in the toll booths on the garden state parkway   one even gave my little dog a biscuit   it was very refreshing      deep peep show    the viewers of the    deep peep show    at 15th and m streets nw have an added attraction    the view of a fossilized cypress swamp   twenty feet below the street level in the excavation of the new motel to be constructed on this site   a black coal like deposit has been encountered   some of the stumps are as much as three feet long   but most of them have been flattened by the pressure of the overlying sediments   1   he said      let s work for peace instead of protection from aggression      i would ask      why not do both        military power does not cause war     war is the result of mistrust and lack of understanding between people   are we not late   especially those of us who call ourselves friends   in doing enough about this lack of understanding     2   as to protection   the speaker disapproved of shelters   pointing out that fallout shelters would not save everyone   is this a reason for saving no one     would the man with an empty life boat row away from a shipwreck because his boat could not pick up everyone     3   if the world comes to this   wouldn t it be the very time when courage and american know how would be needed to help survivors rebuild     many of our young people think it would   4   lastly   the speaker decried our organized program of emergency help calling it    civilian defense      in 1950   public law 920 created civil defense   different from civilian groups of world war 2     a responsibility of the government at all levels to help reduce loss of life and property in disaster   natural or manmade   far from creating fear   as the speaker suggests   preparedness    knowing what to do in an emergency    gives people confidence   civil defense has far to go and many problems to solve   but is it not in the best spirit of our pioneer tradition to be not only willing   but prepared to care for our own families and help our neighbors in any disaster    storm   flood   accident or even war     pets in apartments it seems rather peculiar that residents of apartments are denied the right of providing themselves with the protection and companionship of dogs   in addition   would not the young female public of washington be afforded a greater degree of protection at night when they are on the streets if they were accompanied by a dog on a leash     i grant that the dog may not be really protective   based on his training   but if you were roaming the streets looking for a purse to snatch or a young lady to molest   how quick would you be to attack a person strolling with a dog     i would like to suggest that the landlords and commissioners get together and consider liberalizing the practice of prohibiting dogs in apartments   sidewalk cafes use the terraces of the capitol for a sidewalk cafe     could senator humphrey be serious in his proposal     is nothing in this country more sacred than the tourists  comfort     perhaps the idea of sidewalk cafes could be extended   why not put a cafe in each so the tourists would not have to travel too far to eat     unfortunately the cafes might not make enough money to support themselves during the off season   would jump at the chance   hubert humphrey is obviously a man with a soul and heart   he   like most of us   wants to be able to sit   to contemplate and be moved by the great outdoors   let us have more benches and fewer forbidden areas around fountains and gardens   let us   like the french   have outdoor cafes where we may relax   converse at leisure and enjoy the passing crowd   president kennedy was right when he said      we shall never negotiate out of fear and we never shall fear to negotiate      i have just returned from a seven week trip to europe and the far east   we have no right to criticize them   as they realize they would be sitting ducks in a nuclear war     if the communists are sincere in wanting a united   neutral and disarmed germany   it might well be advantageous for the german people in this nuclear age   why not make a beginning with a united and disarmed germany whose neutrality and immunity from nuclear bombing would be guaranteed by the big four powers and the united states     a united germany   freed of militarism   might be the first step toward disarmament and peace in a terrorized and tortured world   obligations to the editor of the new york times   in your editorial of sept  30    the smoldering congo    you make the following comment      far too many states are following the russian example in refusing to pay their assessments   it is up to the assembly to take action against them   i would like to quote from the charter of the united nations      article 17   section 1     the general assembly shall consider and approve the budget of the organization      article 19     a member of the united nations which is in arrears in the payment of its financial contributions to the organization shall have no vote in the general assembly if the amount of its arrears equals or exceeds the amount of the contributions due from it for the preceding two full years      the u  but they refuse   as do the arab states   to support the united nations  expenses of maintaining the united nations emergency force in the middle east as a buffer between egypt and israel   and the u  troops in the congo   which expenses are not covered by the regular budget of the united nations   but by a special budget   according to the official interpretation of the charter   a member cannot be penalized by not having the right to vote in the general assembly for nonpayment of financial obligations to the    special    united nations  budgets   and of course cannot be expelled from the organization   which you suggested in your editorial     due to the fact that there is no provision in the charter for expulsion   27 editorial appraisal of the work of the first session of the eighty seventh congress you referred to the lack of    consciousness of destiny in a time of acute national and world peril      since the connally amendment has the effect of giving the same right to the other party to a dispute with the united states   it also prevents us from using the court effectively   yet although the kennedy administration   and the eisenhower administration before it   have both declared themselves solidly for repeal of the connally amendment   as contrary to our best interests   no action has yet been taken   our    destiny    in these perilous times should be to lead strongly in the pursuit of peace   with justice   under law   to the tens of thousands who must transfer to ride to seventy fourth street and change for the ind   this takes a daily toll of time and temper   the transit authority has recently placed in operation    hold    lights at bmt thirty ninth and fifty ninth street stations in brooklyn   this    holds    the local until the express passengers change trains   phone service criticized to the editor of the new york times   as a business man i have to use the telephone constantly   from three to four hours a day   in the last few years the telephone company has managed to automate many areas of their service   i have been absolutely shocked at the ineptness of the young ladies who are servicing person to person calls   special long distance calls   etc    either it is lack of training   lack of proper screening when hiring   lack of management or possibly lack of interest on the part of the telephone company   which does have a government blessed monopoly   but the hospitals and doctors should be   helping retarded children to the editor   recently i visited the very remarkable pilgrim school for retarded children   hazel park donates its recreation center   five days a week   to the school   kiwanis   american legion and other groups donate small sums and the mothers do what they can to bring in dollars for its support   there are 70 children there and the mothers donate one day a week to the school   they make beautiful objects   southfield schools furnish an old 45 passenger bus   the heater in which needs repair since some of the children ride a long distance and need the heat     visitors are welcome to come see what these dedicated mothers can do   maybe he can clean out the white elephants in some of the city departments such as welfare   dpw and sanitation   he should put the police back to patrolling and walking the streets at night   our litterbug ordinances are not enforced and i have yet to read of a conviction in a littering case   educate the city employes to give real service to the public   after all   they are paid by the public   they should be examples   united presbyterian church   considerable use was made of material from the detroit news on the king james version of the new testament versus the new english bible   some members of the organization called attention also to the article on hymns of inspiration   the daily prayer and three minutes a day   as being very helpful   rude youngsters to the editor   thank you for the article by george sokolsky on the public apathy to impudence   how old do you have to be to remember when americans   especially children   were encouraged to be polite     why has this form of gentility gone out of american life     how can we old fashioned parents   who still feel that adults are due some respect from children   battle the new type of advertising that appears on tv without denying the children the use of television entirely     writers of ads must get their inspiration from the attitude of    modern    parents they have observed   from necessity   they are also inspired by the    hard sell    attitude of the sponsor   so   finally   it is the sponsor who must take the responsibility for the good or bad taste of his advertising   dunes park advocate to the editor   i commend senator hart for his brave fight to establish a national park in the dunes area   ghost town     to the editor of the inquirer   i just wish to congratulate inspector trimmer and his efficient police troops in cleaning the city of those horrible automobiles   we have now a quiet city   fewer automobiles   less congestion   and fewer retail customers shopping in center city   good for mr  trimmer   maybe he will help to turn our fair city into a    ghost    town   30   sounds like a business man who waits until the last minute to leave his home or shop   the trucks today help pay for this highway   they try to keep within the speed limits   although today s trucks are as fast as passenger cars   a truck driver has to be a sensible person and guard against hogging the road   out of school at 14 to the editor of the inquirer   the letter writer who suggested saving money by taking kids out of school at 14 should have signed his letter    simpleton    instead of    simplicitude      such kids only wind up among the unemployed on relief or in jail where they become a much bigger burden   there are lots of jobs available for trained high school graduates   but not for the dropouts   what we need is more vocational training in high schools   not more dropouts   two wrongs to the editor of the inquirer   i suppose i am missing some elementary point but i honestly cannot see how two wrongs can make a right     i am referring to this country conducting atmosphere tests of nuclear bombs just because russia is   why do we need bigger and better bombs     i repeat   two wrongs do not make a right     we tremble not   to the editor of the inquirer   everyone should take time to read martin luther s hymn    a mighty fortress is our god      especially the first half of the third verse   out of the race to the editor of the inquirer   to our everlasting shame   we led the world in this nuclear arms race sixteen years ago when we dropped the first bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki   having led the world in this mad race i pray that we may have the wisdom and courage to lead it out of the race   are we to be the master of the atom   or will the atom be our master    and destroy us     why trust jagan     to the editor of the inquirer   just because cheddi jagan   new boss of british guiana   was educated in the united states is no reason to think he isn t a red   we have quite a few home grown specimens of our own   how many times must we get burned before we learn     russia and u  to the editor of the inquirer   just to remind the communists that the bombs dropped on japan were to end a war not start one   the war could have continued many years with many thousands killed on both sides       belated tribute to the editor of the inquirer   while    better late than never    may have certain merits   the posthumous award of the nobel prize for peace to the late dag hammarskjold strikes me as less than a satisfactory expression of appreciation   according to one report   however   mr  hammarskjold was considered    too controversial    a figure to warrant bestowal of the coveted honor last spring   actually   of course   that label    controversial    applied only because he was carrying out the mandate given him by the world organization he headed rather than following the dictates of the soviet union     people to people   to the editor of the inquirer   just a brief note of appreciation to vice president johnson and pakistani camel driver bashir ahmad for providing a first class example of    people to people    good will   if only this could be done more often    with such heartening results    many of the earth s    big problems    would shrink to the insignificances they really are     thanks for your good coverage of ahmad s visit   too     expressway answer   east river drive to the editor of the inquirer   your continuing editorials concerning the schuylkill expressway are valuable     however   several pertinent considerations deserve recognition   one of the problems associated with the expressway stems from the basic idea   they start on the east side of the schuylkill   have to cross over to the west to use the expressway and cross over again to the east at their destination   each one of these is   by its nature   a focal point or a point of natural congestion   we should avoid these congestion points or   putting it another way   keep cars starting and ending on the east side of the river    on the east side   this can be accomplished by several logical steps     1   widen the east river drive at least one lane     2   so widen it as to minimize the present curves and eliminate drainage problems   shadow over washington square to the editor of the inquirer   i wish to advocate two drastic changes in washington square   1   2   replace it with the statue of one or another of the world s famous dictators   washington square seems not part of a free land   it may remind one of russia   china or east berlin     but it can t remind one of the freedom that washington and the continental soldiers fought for   the fairmount park commission will no doubt approve my two proposals   because it is responsible for the change of ideological atmosphere in the square   the matter may seem a small thing to some people   i know   but it s a very good start on the road to totalitarianism the commission has posted signs in washington square saying   the feeding of birds is prohibited in this square   fairmount park commission does each tentacle of the octopus of city government reach out and lash at whatever it dislikes or considers an annoyance     if birds don t belong in a square or park   what does     they are the most beautiful part of that little piece of nature   the trees are their homes     but the commission does not share such sentiments   starlings and blackbirds are scared off by canon   from city hall   the city government is not united in an all out   to the death drive to stamp out gangs   delinquents   thugs   murderers   rapists   subversives   indeed no   let every policeman and park guard keep his eye on john and jane doe   lest one piece of bread be placed undetected and one bird survive   of course   in this small way of forcing the people to watch as tiny and innocent and dependent creatures die because we re afraid to feed them and afraid to protest and say      how come     what s your motive     who wants this deed done           in this small way do the leaders of a city   or of a nation   inure the masses to watching   or even inflicting   torture and death   upon even their fellow men   one means to help the birds occurs to me   let the chimes that ring over washington square twice daily   discontinue any piece of music but one   let them offer on behalf of those creatures whose melody has been the joy of mankind since time began   the hymn    abide with me      we will know   and he will know   to whom it is rendered   what the birds would ask   not push ups but stand ups to the editor of the inquirer   there is a trend today to bemoan the fact that americans are too    soft      unfortunately   those who would remedy our    softness    seek to do so with calisthenics   they are working on the wrong part of our anatomy   it is not our bodies but our hearts and heads that have grown too soft   ashamed of our wealth and power   afraid of so called world opinion and addicted to peace   we have allowed our soft heartedness to lead to soft headed policies   when we become firm enough to stand for those ideals which we know to be right   when we become hard enough to refuse to aid nations which do not permit self determination   when we become strong enough to resist any more drifts towards socialism in our own nation   when we recognize that our enemy is communism not war   and when we realize that concessions to communists do not insure peace or freedom   then   and only then will we no longer be    soft      america doesn t need to    push up      she needs to stand up     disputes stans column business scandal views to the editor   the new column by maurice stans regarding business scandals   is fair and accurate in most respects and his solution to the problem has some merit   however   he states unequivocally    the scandals in business are far less significant than the scandals in labor      i must   in fairness   take issue with his premise   primarily because the so called scandals in labor unions were very much connected with business scandals   the area most prominently commented on during the mcclellan hearings had to do with    sweetheart contracts      it is being fought   moreover   in fairly close correspondence with the predictions of the soothsayers of the think factories   some time ago   however   mr  he seems to have at least a few 30  and 50 megaton bombs on hand   since we cannot assume that he has exploded his entire stock   and now   of course   the hue and cry for counter escalation is being raised on our side   khrushchev threatens us with a 100 megaton bomb     so be it    then we must embark on a crash program for 200 megaton bombs of the common or hydrogen variety   and neutron bombs   which do not exist but are said to be the coming thing   so escalation proceeds   ad infinitum or   more accurately   until the contestants begin dropping them on each other instead of on their respective proving grounds   what is needed   philip morrison writes in the cornell daily sun   october 26   is a discontinuity   the escalation must end sometime   and probably quite soon      only a discontinuity can end it      professor morrison writes      the discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction   or that of diplomatic policy      morrison points out that since our country is more urbanized than the soviet union or red china   it is the most vulnerable of the great powers    europe of course must be written off out of hand   he feels   therefore   that to seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the united states is the least risky path our government can take   these gentlemen are calling for a resumption of testing    in the atmosphere    on the greatest possible scale   all in the name of national security   not terror   but anger and resentment have been the general reaction outside the soviet sphere   when one powerful nation strives to emulate the success of another   it is only natural   but to imitate an opponent when he has made the mistake of his life would be a new high in statesmanlike folly   the flood is not as great    only 700 a week according to one apparently conservative account    but it is symptomatic   west berlin morale is low and   in age distribution   the situation is unfavorable   crossman   m    writing in the manchester guardian   states that departures from west berlin are now running at the rate not of 700   but of 1 700 a week   and applications to leave have risen to 1 900 a week   the weekly loss is partly counterbalanced by 500 arrivals each week from west germany   but the hard truth   says crossman   is that    the closing off of east berlin without interference from the west and with the use only of east german   as distinct from russian   troops was a major communist victory   which dealt west berlin a deadly   possibly a fatal   blow   another piece of evidence appears in a dispatch from bonn in the observer   london     mark arnold foster writes      people are leaving   west berlin   because they think it is dying   the handwriting is on the wall   the only hope for west berlin lies in a compromise which will bring down the wall and reunite the city   tanks lined up at the border will be no more helpful   the materials for compromise are at hand   the nation   walter lippmann and other sober commentators   see alan clark on p  367   have spelled them out again and again   vacancy the removal of stalin s body from the mausoleum he shared with lenin to less distinguished quarters in the kremlin wall is not unprecedented in history   it is   in fact   a relatively mild chastisement of the dead   a british writer   richard haestier   in a book   dead men tell tales   recalls that in the turmoil preceding the french revolution the body of henry 4     who had died nearly 180 years earlier   was torn to pieces by a mob   and in england   after the restoration   the body of cromwell was disinterred and hanged at tyburn   the head was then fixed on a pole at westminster   and the rest of the body was buried under the gallows   in 1899   parliament erected a statue to cromwell in westminster   facing whitehall and there   presumably   he still stands   who will take stalin s place beside lenin     there is karl marx   of course   buried in london   the macmillan government might be willing to let him go   but he has been dead seventy eight years and even the soviet morticians could not make him look presentable   who   then   is of sufficient stature to lodge with lenin     who but nikita himself     since he has just shown who is top dog   he may not be ready to receive this highest honor in the gift of the soviet people   besides   he can hardly avoid musing on the instability of death which   what with exhumations and rehabilitations   seems to match that of life   suppose he did lie beside lenin   would it be permanent     if some future khrushchev decided to rake up the misdeeds of his revered predecessor   would not the factory workers pass the same resolutions applauding his dispossession     when a man is laid to rest   he is entitled to stay put   s acting secretary general    at this writing   the choice appears to be certain    offers further proof that in politics it is more important to have no influential enemies than to have influential friends   what is interesting is that his positive qualifications for the post were revealed only as a kind of tail to his candidacy   in all the bitter in fighting   the squabbles over election procedures   the complicated numbers game that east and west played on the assistant secretaries  theme   the gentleman from burma showed himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat   he has   moreover   another qualification which augurs well for the future   he is a buddhist   which means that to him peace and the sanctity of human life are not only religious dogma   but a profound and unshakable weltanschauung   u thant of course   will hold office until the spring of 1963   when mr  hammarskjold s term would have come to an end   khrushchev s demand for a troika is dormant   not dead     the west may or not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism that u thant represents   in a sense   the showdown promised by mr  to the hills   girls   these are mentalities which crave action    and they are beginning to get it   as messrs  even in areas where political connotations are   deliberately       left vague   the spirit of vigilantism is spreading   friends   a picture magazine distributed by chevrolet dealers   describes a paramilitary organization of employees of the gulf telephone company at foley   alabama      if the day should ever come that foreign invaders swarm ashore along the gulf coast      the account reads      they can count on heavy opposition from a group of commando trained telephone employees    all girls   the girls   very fetching in their uniforms   are shown firing rockets from a launcher mounted on a dump truck     they are also trained with carbines   automatic weapons   pistols   rifles and other such ladies  accessories   the doctrine has never worked     it is not working now   the official military establishment can only threaten to use its nuclear arms     it cannot bring them into actual play   as the civic temper rises   the more naive citizens begin to play soldier    but the guns are real   soon they will begin to hunt down the traitors they are assured are in our midst   but there is reason in all things   and in this country the heathenish cult of the motor car is exceeding all bounds in its demands   if the railroads   for example   regularly slaughtered 25 000 passengers each year   the high priests of the cult would have cause to tremble for their personal safety   for such a holocaust would excite demands for the hanging of every railroad president in the united states   yet it is plainly time to make a start   and to be effective the first move should be highly dramatic   without being fanatical   here   then   is what swift would have called a modest proposal by way of a beginning   from next new year s day let us keep careful account of each successive fatality on the highways   publicizing it on all media of communication   to avoid suspicion of bigotry   let the hand of vengeance be stayed until the meat wagon has picked up the twenty five thousandth corpse     but let the twenty five thousand and first butchery be the signal for the arrest of the 50 state highway commissioners   the scene   of course   should be nine miles northwest of centralia   illinois   the geographical center of population according to the census   the band should play the rogues  march as a processional   switching to    hail columbia   happy land        as the trap is sprung   independence day is the appropriate date as a symbolical reminder of the american article of faith that governments are instituted among men to secure to them certain inalienable rights   the first of which is life   and when any government becomes subversive of that end   it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it   moreover   the salubrious effects would not be exclusively political   but at least partially   and perhaps primarily social   it would challenge sharply not the cult of the motor car itself but some of its ancillary beliefs and practices    for instance   the doctrine that the fulfillment of life consists in proceeding from hither to yon   not for any advantage to be gained by arrival but merely to avoid the cardinal sin of stasis   or   as it is generally termed   staying put   true   the adherents of staying put are now reduced to a minor   even a miniscule sect   and their credo      home keeping hearts are happiest      is as disreputable as socinianism   perhaps there is more truth than we are wont to admit in the conviction of that ornament of tarheelia   robert ruark s grandfather   who was persuaded that the great curse of the modern world is    all this gallivantin       since appeals to morality   to humanity   and to sanity have had such small effect   perhaps our last recourse is the deterrent example   but the guilt is shared by the united states   britain and france   the other members of the atomic club   as it descends   the concentration of radioactivity builds up in the human body     for a dose of radiation is not like a flu virus which causes temporary discomfort and then dies   the effect of radiation is cumulative over the years    and on to succeeding generations   on october 19   after the soviets had detonated at least 20 nuclear devices   ambassador stevenson warned the un general assembly that this country   in    self protection      might have to resume above ground tests   more recently   the chairman of the atomic energy commission   dr  seaborg      admitted    to a news conference in las vegas   nevada   that the us might fall behind russia   he apparently meant in weapons development   if the soviets continue to test in the atmosphere while we abstain   but for the average citizen   unfortunately   this is one of science s worst marked channels   full of tricky currents and unknown depths   the scientists   in and out of government   do not agree on some of the most vital points   at least publicly   but the phs conceded that the new radioactive particles    will add to the risk of genetic effects in succeeding generations   and possibly to the risk of health damage to some people in the united states      then it added      it is not possible to determine how extensive these ill effects will be    nor how many people will be affected      having hedged its bets in this way   phs apparently decided it would be possible to make some sort of determination after all      at present radiation levels   and even at somewhat higher levels   the additional risk is slight and very few people will be affected      then   to conclude on an indeterminate note      nevertheless   if fallout increased substantially   or remained high for a long time   it would become far more important as a potential health hazard in this country and throughout the world      linus pauling   a nobel prize winner in chemistry   has been less ambiguous   whether you choose to agree with him or not   thomas lauritsen   reported in a note elsewhere in this issue of the new republic   a recent study on radiation exposure by the aec s division of biology and medicine stated      the question of the biological effect of   radiation   doses is not considered    herein   of course   the aec is in a bind now   if it comes down too hard on the potential dangers of fallout   it will box the president on resuming atmospheric tests   now   of course   that the russians are the nuclear villains   radiation is a nastier word than it was in the mid   when the us was testing in the atmosphere   the prevailing official attitude then seemed to be that fallout   if not exactly good for you   might not be much worse than a bad cold   after a nuclear blast   one bureaucrat suggested in those halcyon days   about all you had to do was haul out the broom and sweep off your sidewalks and roof   how much fallout will we get     as of october 25   the aec had reported 24 shots in the new soviet series   12 of them in a megaton range   including a super bomb with a yield of 30 to 50 megatons   the equivalent of 30 million to 50 million tons of tnt       and president kennedy indicated there were one or two more than those reported   when this second dilemma first became obvious    during the mid to late  50 s    the united states appeared to have three choices   it could have continued testing to the full on the grounds that the radiation danger was far less than the danger of communist world domination   or it could have chosen to find    by negotiation    some way of stopping the tests without loss to national security   this third choice was in fact made   once again   the united states must choose   and once again   the choices are much the same   the third choice   negotiation   presupposes   as russian behavior demonstrates   a great deal of wishful thinking to make it appear reasonable   we take the position   however   that the third choice still remains the only sane one open to us   its primary advantage is that it is a moral choice     one which   should it fail   will not have contaminated the conscience   speaking recently in miami   governor rockefeller said that    to assure the sufficiency of our own weapons in the face of the recent soviet tests   we are now clearly compelled to conduct our own nuclear tests      taking account of the fact that such a move on our part would be unpopular in world opinion   he argued that the responsibility of the united states is    to do   confidently and firmly   not what is popular   but what is right      recent statements by the president and defense department spokesmen have   to the contrary   assured us that our lead is very great   unless the administration and the defense department have been deceiving us   the facts do not support the assertion that we are    compelled    to resume atmospheric testing   it is perfectly conceivable that a resumption of atmospheric tests may   at some point in the future   be necessary and even justifiable   the refusal to resume atmospheric testing would be a good start   with good reason it appeared that a new day was upon divided christendom   as it has turned out   however   the excessive enthusiasm in the first instance and the loss of hope in the second were both wrong responses   two things have happened in recent months to bring the council into perspective   each provides a basis for renewed hope and joy   the establishment   by the holy father   of a permanent secretariat for christian unity in 1960 was the most dramatic mark of this concern   the designation of five catholic theologians to attend the world council of churches assembly in new delhi as    official    observers reverses the church s earlier stand   noting all the difficulties that stand in the way of reunion   he has said that they ought not to discourage anyone   for discouragement   or the temptation to abandon our efforts      would show that one placed excessive trust in purely human means without thinking of the omnipotence of god   the irresistible efficacy of prayer   the action of christ or the power of the divine spirit      kennedy   but we feel bound to say that his budget review doesn t please us either   although for very different reasons   in the first place   a large part of the discrepancy between president eisenhower s estimate of a 1  the rest of the deficit is also easily understood   eisenhower  5 billion   because of unusual weather factors   the food for peace program and other new measures   anti recession programs    aid for the unemployed   their children and for depressed areas    account for only 900 million of the 6  our complaint is that in many crucial areas the kennedy programs are not too large but too small   most seriously in regard to the conventional arms build up and in aid and welfare measures   kennedy persists in trying to mollify the intransigents of the right with apologies and promises of    tightening up    and    economizing      we wish the president would remember that    fiscal responsibility    was the battle cry of the party that lost the election   the party that won used to say something about a new frontier   ethics and peace introduction of the    dialogue    principle proved strikingly effective at the thirty fourth annual meeting of the catholic association for international peace in washington the last weekend in october   two of the principal addresses were delivered by prominent protestants   and when the speaker was a catholic   one    discussant    on the dais tended to be of another religious persuasion   sessions devoted to    ethics and foreign policy trends         moral principle and political judgment         christian ethics in the cold war    and related subjects proved to be much livelier under this procedure than if catholics were merely talking to themselves   that aristotelean thomistic principle experienced a thorough going over from a number of the participants   but in the end the concept came to reassert itself   speakers declared that protestants often make use of it   if   perhaps   by some other name   a lebanese moslem told about its existence and application in the islamic tradition as the    divine law      while a c a  member who has been working in close association with delegates of the new u  the impression was unmistakable that   whatever one may choose to call it   natural law is a functioning generality with a certain objective existence   one effect of the spirited give and take of these discussions was to focus attention on practical applications and the necessity of being armed with the facts   knowledge of the destructive force of even the tiniest    tactical    atomic weapon would have a bearing on judgments as to the advisability of its use    to defend berlin   for example     the pervasive influence of ideology on our political judgments needs to be recognized and taken into due account     it is necessary to perceive the extent of foreign aid demanded by the christian imperative   i was searching for an accent of self delusion or   even   of hypocrisy   i never found it among any of the chinese with whom i spoke   though granted they were   almost all   members of the official family who   presumably   harbor official thoughts   their answer was   it can be done   and we will do it   and then i put the question as pointedly as i could directly to chiang kai shek      in america      i said      practically no one believes that you subjectively intend to re enter the mainland   what evidence is there of an objective kind that in fact your government proposes to do just that   and that it can be done        he smiled     he always smiles    at least at visitors   i gather   he smiled also at a british bloke seated next to me   who asked the most asinine questions   i recalled sympathetically the duke s complaint in browning s    my last duchess        he smiled   and said a word or two to the interpreter   who turned to me      the president wonders where you are going after you leave taipei        that   i smarted   is a royal rebuff if ever there was one      the president says      the translator came in      that the reason he asked you where you were going is because he hoped you would be visiting other areas in southeast asia   and that everywhere you went   you would seek the answer to your question   he says that if he were to express to you   once again   his own profound determination to go to the mainland   and his faith that that return is feasible   he would merely sound redundant   so you yourself must seek these objective data   and come to your own conclusions   any information we have here in taiwan is at your disposal      what are the relevant data     for every person on taiwan   there are sixty in mainland china   the estimates vary widely on the strength of the chinese army   say four million   skill     training     morale     it is generally conceded that the formosan air force is the best by far in asia   and the army the best trained   the morale is very high   even so   it adds up to impossible odds   except that the question arises   on whose side would the mainland chinese army fight     the miserable people of china   the largest cast ever conscripted to enact an ideological passion play   cannot themselves resist overtly   they think   perforce   of physical survival   everything else is secondary   but the army which mao continues to feed well   where are its sympathies     the psychological strategists in taiwan stress the great sense of family   cultivated in china over thousands of years   every soldier in the army has   somewhere   relatives who are close to starvation   the soldiers themselves cannot stage a successful rebellion   it is assumed   but will their discontent spread to the officer class     the immediate families of the generals and the admirals are well fed   a despot does not economize on his generals   but there are the cousins and aunts and nephews   in behalf of what     leninism marxism   as understood by exegete mao   to whom will the generals stay loyal     there is little doubt if they had a secret ballot   they would vote for food for their family   in place of ideological purity out on the farm   it is another question whether    they       or a single general   off in a corner of china   secure for a few   galvanizing       days at least from instant retaliation    will defy the party   but there must be a catalytic pressure   the military in taiwan believe that the communists have made two mistakes   which   together   may prove fatal   the family is largely broken up     and where it is not   it is left with no residue   and the social meaning of this is enormous   for it is the family that   in china   has always provided social security for the indigent   the sick   the down and out members of the clan   now the government must do that     but the government is left with no reserve granary   under the agricultural system it has ordained   the second mistake is tibet   a friendly state   sometimes only semi independent   but never hostile   red china is trying to do this   and she is not likely ever to succeed   these continuing pressures   social   economic and military   are doing much to keep china in a heightening state of tension   the imposition of yet another pressure   a strong one   from the outside   might cause it to snap   they know that they must depend heavily on factors outside their own control   first and foremost   they depend on the inhuman idiocies of the communist regime   on these they feel they can rely   secondly   they depend on america s    moral cooperation    when the crucial moment arrives   he affected   most properly   not to understand my point   but he    and all of china    wears the scars of american indecisiveness   and he knows what an uncertain ally we are   we have been grand to formosa itself    lots of aid   and   most of the time   a policy of support for the offshore islands   but our outlook has been   and continues to be   defensive   the free chinese know that the situation on the mainland is in flux   and are poised to strike   the moment of truth is the moment of crisis   during the slow buildup   the essence of a policy or a man is concealed under embroidered details   fine words   strutting gestures   there the truth is   open to eyes that are willing to look   the moment passes   before memory   too   clouds over   let us make a note or two of what could be seen   one knows better   now   who has bone and who has jelly in his spine   but i am here concerned more with policy than with men   public men come and go but great issues of policy remain   now   everyone knows    or knew in the week of december 10    that something had gone shockingly wrong with american foreign policy   but in the moment of truth everyone could see that the u  was in reality the principal   by our policy the west was    is    split   but the key revelation is not new   it reappears   in whole or part   whenever a new crisis exposes the reality   in cuba last spring   with which the dominican events of last month should be paired       at the peaks of the nuclear test and the berlin cycles     in relation to laos   algeria   south africa     right now   with almost cartoon emphasis   in the temporally linked complex of tshombe gizenga goa ghana   can take the initiative against the right   but cannot take the initiative against the left   it makes no difference what part of the world is involved   what form of regime   what particular issue   the u  cannot take the initiative against the left   we can attack tshombe   but not gigenza     we can force britain and france out of the suez   but we cannot so much as try to force the russian tanks back from budapest   we can mass our fleet against the trujillos   but not against the castros   we can vote in the un against south african apartheid or portuguese rule in angola   but we cannot even introduce a motion on the berlin wall    much less   give the simple order to push the wall down   what explains this uni directional paralysis     it is the consequence of the system of ideas that constitutes the frame of our international    and in some degree our domestic    policy   the suez hungary crisis proves that this system was not invented by the new administration   but only made more consistent and more active   from this belief is derived the practical orientation of our policy on the    uncommitted         neutralist         contested      nations   especially on those whose leaders make the most noise    nehru   tito   nkrumah   sukarno   betancourt   etc    if we grasp this orientation as a key   our national conduct in all of the events here mentioned becomes intelligible   and it becomes clear why in general we cannot take the initiative against the left   broadway the unoriginals to write a play   the dramatist once needed an idea plus the

books   notably life with father and diary of anne frank   and particularly in the musical field   adaptations have long been the rule   from die fledermaus and the merry widow to oklahoma  and my fair lady   as critic walter kerr points out      adaptations   so long as they are good   still qualify as creative      the difference is that the masters took the bare frame of a plot and filled it with their own world     most modern adapters totally accept the world of a book   squeeze it dry of life   and add only one contribution of their own   stage technique   but that explanation is only

glides sideways with shoulders motionless while her stomach migrates   and   through breathing and muscle control   she sends ripples across her body to the fingertips and away to the far end of the room   this is done at varying speeds   ranging from the slow and fast shifte telli   a musical term meaning double strings   to the fastest   ecstatic karshilama   meaning greetings or welcome     the new york dancers are highly eclectic   varying the pattern with all kinds of personal improvisations   back bends or floor crawls   but they do not strip   the striptease is crass     the belly

first three of which he spent desperately trying to make paintings on the wall with his own spittle   it was not until the last year of his life that he had his first moneymaking show   the unabashed sexuality of so many of his paintings was not the only thing that kept the public at bay   his view of the world was one of almost unrelieved tragedy   and it was too much even for morbid minded

soviet communist party is that it is surprising    perhaps quite as much   in its own way   as the twentieth congress of 1956   which ended with that famous    secret    report on stalin   the publication last july of the party s draft program    that blueprint for the    transition to communism       had led the uninitiated to suppose that this twenty second congress would be a sort of apotheosis of the khrushchev regime   a solemn consecration of ideas which had   in fact   been current over the last three or four years   i    since the defeat of the    anti party group      in all theoretical party journals   these never ceased to suggest that if   in the eyes of marx and lenin    full communism    was still a very distant ideal   the establishment of a communist society had now   under khrushchev   become an    immediate and tangible reality      it seems that khrushchev himself took a very special pride in having made a world shaking contribution to marxist doctrine with his draft program   a large part of his twelve hour speech at the recent congress was   in fact   very largely a rehash of that interminable document     he and other soviet leaders responsible for the document were proud of having brought forward some new formulas   such as the early replacement of the dictatorship of the proletariat by an    all people s state      and also of having laid down the lines for a much greater    democratization    of the whole hierarchy of soviets   starting with the supreme soviet itself   their plan for rotation of leaders promised a salutary blow at    bureaucracy    and would enable    the people    to take a more direct and active part in running the country   also   elections would be more democratic     there might even be two or more candidates for voters to choose from   no doubt   there was still a lot in the draft program    and in khrushchev s speech    which left many points obscure     state farms   which were   moreover   to be progressively    urbanized          as we know   the soviet peasant today still very largely thrives on being able to sell the produce grown on his private plot     and it is still very far from certain how valid the party s claim is that in    a growing number of kolkhozes    the peasants are finding it more profitable   to surrender their private plots to the kolkhoz and to let the latter be turned into something increasingly like a state farm   if one follows the reports of the congress   one finds that there still seems considerable uncertainty in the minds of the leaders themselves about what exactly to do in this matter   it contained   for example   a number of curious admissions about the peasants   who enjoy no sickness benefits   no old age pensions   no paid holidays     they still benefit far less than the    other    50 per cent of the nation from that    welfare state    which the soviet union so greatly prides itself on being   over all these fairly awkward problems khrushchev was to skate rather lightly     and   though he repeated   over and over again   the spectacular figures of industrial and agricultural production in 1980   the    ordinary    people in russia are still a little uncertain as to how    communism    is really going to work in practice   especially in respect of food   himself seemed to have some doubts     for he kept on threatening that he would    pull the ears    of those responsible for agricultural production   one cannot but wonder whether these doubts about the success of khrushchev s agricultural policy have not at least something to do with one of the big surprises provided by this congress    the obsessive harping on the crimes and misdeeds of the    anti party group       molotov   malenkov   kaganovich and others    including the eighty year old marshal voroshilov   molotov   in particular   is being charged with all kinds of sins    especially with wanting to cut down free public services   to increase rents and fares     in fact   with having been against all the more popular features of the khrushchev    welfare state      the trouble with all these doctrinal quarrels is that we hear only one side of the story   what   in the secret councils of the kremlin   molotov had really proposed   we just don t know   and he has had no chance to reply   but one cannot escape the suspicion that all this non stop harping on the misdeeds of the long liquidated    anti party    group would be totally unnecessary if there were not   inside the party   some secret but genuine opposition to khrushchev on vital doctrinal grounds   on the actual methods to be employed in the    transition to communism    and   last but not least   on foreign policy   the whole problem of    peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition    with the capitalist world is in the very center of this congress   mikoyan declared      molotov altogether rejects the line of peaceful coexistence   reducing this concept merely to the state of peace or rather   the absence of war at a given moment   and to a denial of the possibility of averting a world war   his views   in fact   coincide with those of foreign enemies of peaceful coexistence   who look upon it merely as a variant of the    cold war    or of an    armed peace      one cannot help wondering whether molotov and the rest of the    anti party group    are not being used as china s whipping boys by khrushchev and his faithful followers   for something   clearly   has gone very   very seriously wrong in soviet chinese relations   which were never easy   and have now deteriorated     has shifted the whole attention of the world   including that of the soviet people   from the    epoch making    twenty year program to the present soviet chinese conflict     as something thoroughly dictatorial and    undemocratic        but the albanian leaders went out of their way to be openly abusive to khrushchev   calling him a liar   a bully   and so on   the big question is whether   in the name of a restored chinese soviet solidarity   the chinese will choose to persuade the albanians to present their humble apologies to khrushchev    or get rid of enver hoxa   these seem about the only two ways in which the    unhappy incident    can now be closed   khrushchev   for all his bombastic prophecies about the inevitable decay of capitalism   is genuinely favorable to    peaceful coexistence    and would like   above all   the berlin and german problems to be settled peacefully     he knows that he was never more popular than at the time of the russo american    honeymoon    of 1959   but it seems that pressures against him are coming from somewhere    in the first place from china   but perhaps also from that    china lobby    which   i was assured in moscow nearly two years ago   exists on the quiet inside the party   and the chinese   as the albanian incident shows   have strong suspicions that khrushchev is anxious to secure a    shameful    peace with the west   and one cannot but wonder whether marshal malinovsky   who was blowing hot and cold   exalting peace but also almost openly considering the possibility of preventive war against the west   wasn t trying to keep the chinese quiet   and this brings us inevitably to the 30  or 50 megaton bomb   was not this dropped primarily in order to    appease    the chinese    especially after    khrushchev s    humiliating    surrender to the west in canceling the german peace treaty deadline of december 31     what does it all add up to     indications are that khrushchev   and   with him   the bulk of the soviet people   favor peaceful coexistence and   with the exception of berlin   the maintenance of the status quo in the world   the chinese   north vietnamese and north koreans   on the other hand   feel that   militarily   russia is strong enough to support them in the    just wars of liberation    they would like to embark on before long   with china attacking formosa and the north koreans and north vietnamese liberating the southern half of their respective countries   perhaps khrushchev is in a more difficult position than any since 1957   when the    anti party group    nearly liquidated him   he seems strong enough inside the party to cope with any internal opposition     but if he is up against china s crusading spirit in world affairs   he is going to be faced with the most agonizing choice in his life   he may support china   but he won t       he may break with china   which would be infernally difficult and perhaps disastrous     or he may succeed   by all kinds of dangerous concessions   in persuading china to be patient   the next days may show where things stand   eleven men   a woman and a teen age boy tramped over cold   damp   fog enshrouded ground during a two hour field drill in the problems of guerrilla warfare   to the average american   this must sound like an incredible tale from a saturday night tv movie   but to the minutemen   this is a serious business   they feel that world war 3   has already begun   and they are setting themselves up as a    last line of defense    against the communist advance   the maneuvers were held    in secret    after a regional seminar for the minutemen   held in nearby shiloh   ill  undismayed by this contretemps   a small band of the faithful gathered at lauchli s home at 6 30 a  the next day   put on their uniforms   and headed for a farm several miles away   after a tortuous drive in an open truck and a world war 2   army jeep down soggy trails   the band arrived at a small clearing squeezed between a long   low ridge and a creek filled gully   here the two leaders   depugh and lauchli   hastened to put the group through its paces   the minutemen were instructed in the use of terrain for concealment   they practiced movement behind a smoke screen laid by smoke grenades     and they attempted a skirmish line of advance against a camouflaged enemy encampment   depugh   the mother of five children and an active member of her husband s organization   participated in all the exercises   there were no    casualties      but the    guerrillas    admitted to being    a little tired    when the leaders called a halt at 9 a  to enable out of town members to catch a plane   16     it has to do with teachers  salaries and tenure   teaching is at present a sellers  market     as a result buyers   the public   must be satisfied with second rate teachers   but this is not the real problem     the rub arises from the fact that teachers are usually paid on the basis of time served rather than quality   hence all teachers   good and bad   who have been teaching for a given number of years are paid the same salary   the only hope which good teachers have for being paid their due is to stop dragging the dead weight of poor teachers up the economic ladder with them   here   as in all sectors of the economy   quality and justice are both dependent on the right of the individual to deal directly with his employer if he so chooses   loss of initiative on the eve of the    great debate    on the proposal to give the president broad powers to make across the board tariff concessions which could practically bring us into the atlantic community   we should face the alternatives on this proposition   18   as a desirable organization for us to join   for him to ignore the political consequences involved in an atlantic union of this kind is difficult to understand   the pressure for our entry to the common market is mounting and we will proceed towards this amalgamated trade union by way of a purely    economic thoroughfare      or garden path   with the political ramifications kept neatly in the background   the appeal is going to be to the pocketbook and may be very convincing to those who do not see its relation to political and legal   as well as economic   self rule   in entering this union we will be surrendering most   if not all   of our economic autonomy to international bodies such as the atlantic institute   recently set up   or the o    i  and others   12

 he says      we see a nation that traditionally values sovereignty above all else willing to give up its economy   placing this authority in continental hands      frankly   it is being very cleverly done for   in a sense   they have us over a barrel   listen to what mr  johnston has to say      consider the savage wounds that isolationism would inflict   but the solution to this dilemma is not the incorporation of the united states into an atlantic community or    economic empire      but merely what libertarians like henry hazlitt and ludwig von mises have been arguing for years   an end to government regulations   an end to government competition in industry   and a realistic depreciation allowance for industry   create a free market here   give us a sound   debt free money system   and we ll compete with anyone   europe and asia combined   in short   get this governmental monstrosity off our backs and we won t have to worry about european competition or communism either   if we want to preserve our sovereignty   this is the way to do it     not acquiesce to an international planning board      ed    mental telepathy     the peiping chinese were the only major silver seller

praised the idea of a televised press conference and the chance it gives the people to form intelligent opinions   to begin with   the all powerful los angeles times does not publish a transcript of these press conferences   next   because of the time differential   the conferences come on the networks during the middle of the day     even then   a few of the    less interesting    questions are edited out and glibly summarized by a commentator   this is no criticism of them   as they obviously cannot get a half hour program into a fifteen minute news summary   the radio stations did run    transcripts      i thought   during the evening hours   i am interested to know he is getting mail from all over the country about the    abuse    he is being subjected to   we out here don t see enough of the conference to know he is being abused   i don t know if this is the situation in other parts of the country     apparently it is not   it also happened with the inauguration   which was not re run at all during the evening hours   and i wrote to the tv editor of the times   he did mention in his column the fact that he had received many letters about this and he himself did not understand the networks and the independent local stations  not doing this    but nothing happened   can you bring the networks  attention to this     for a college of propaganda i was interested in james webb young s madison avenue column in which he raised the question      do we need a college of propaganda          sr   feb  11     in my estimation   we definitely do     and the sad part of it is that we had one   which was rounding into excellent shape   and we let it disintegrate and die   during the war   we set up schools for the teaching of psychological warfare   which included the teaching of propaganda   both black and white and the various shades of grey in between   we had a couple of schools in this country   the principal one being on the marshall field estate out in lloyd s neck   there were also a couple in canada   and several in england   four of us here in the united states attended   first as students   then as instructors   almost every one of these schools   in england   canada   and the united states   we set up the lloyd s neck school   worked out its curriculum   and taught there   when the end did come   and the schools were disbanded and abandoned   we felt and hoped that the machinery of psychological warfare would not be allowed to rust   alas   no such thing happened   and not one of the four men who attended all the schools has ever been called on to apply any of his knowledge in any way   congratulations on the article    do we need a college of propaganda        this is one of the most constructive suggestions made in this critical field in years   and i certainly hope it sparks some action   let the media clean house   too many of us in public relations were flattered that richard l  snow storm i was surprised and sorry to find in

    watson watt s remarks in sr did not then   constitute a review of the book but a rebuttal to the godkin lectures   it calls the conclusion admitted valid by    historians and military strategists alike    a    perverted conclusion   nonsense      it submits an enthusiastic   impressionistic conception of lindemann contributing another aspect of the man   but on no more authoritative basis than sir charles  account   we are left to choose between the two lindemanns   the only fact that holds any weight in the article is the result of the tea party   but we are to believe that lindemann actively supported radar outside the tizard committee   and dissembling   discounted it inside     if so   i would lean to sir charles  conception of the man   i think it was a grave error to print the article at this time
